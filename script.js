// console.log(`hello world`)

// console log showing flavors and number of times it was ordered

// Prompt user to enter a list of froyo flavors separated by commas.

// Capture the user input as a string.

// Loop through the array of flavors.

// For each flavor in the array:

// Check if the flavor already exists in the object.
